Hi, I'm Will. I enjoy maps enough that I decided to make a career out of it. Out of grad school, Esri kindly agreed to hire me into my first real job as a technical consultant in their professional services division. In this role, my work in mainly focused on deploying and maintaining indoor GIS and indoor positioning systems.

Outside of my work at Esri -- which I can't write about on a personal blog -- I have a number of personal projects that I can. Please check them out on my blog.
